# this demo is meant to set and get data on the nexus amplifier using the serial port
# in practice we can turn on the amplifier and adjust its settings when starting an experiment
# this will help us achieve data integrity
# we can also run tests before starting an experiment to verify that the amplifier is functioning properly
